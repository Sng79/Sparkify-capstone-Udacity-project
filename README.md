# Sparkify-capstone-Udacity-project
Project for Udacity nanodegree program
Libraries required for the project:

Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
PySpark
Spark

Project Motivation
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. The aim is to evaluate user activity for an app called Sparkify  and to predict user churn. Sparkify is a similar app to Spotify. The dataset provided includes a user activity log for the past few months. It contains  information about the users and the specific actions they have taken, which lead to various entries for the user. The cancelation action can be used to know when the user has logged on. 

Files Description
the main notebook is the sparkly project where we do all the preprocessing, feature engineering and modelling.

Results
Three different models were trained with the dataset provided:  Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and Gradient Boosted Trees. 
Their performance was compared using the F1 metric score 
The best result was obtained for the Random forest Classifier:
The F-1 Score is 0.7391304347826086
The accuracy is 0.6618993135011442
